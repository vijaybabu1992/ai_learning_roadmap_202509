# 🚀 AI Learning Roadmap (Sep–Dec 2025)

Welcome to my **AI Learning Roadmap repo**!  
I’m Vijay 👋 — a Data Scientist on a journey to **master AI by the end of 2025**, including modern **Agentic AI** systems.  

This repo will track my **roadmap, notes, code, and progress logs** as I learn step by step with **hands-on projects**.  

---

## 🎯 Goal
By **December 2025**, I want to:
- Build strong foundations in **Python, Math, Stats, ML, Deep Learning**.
- Work on **end-to-end projects** (ML + AI).
- Explore **Generative AI** & **Agentic AI** applications.
- Share my **learning progress publicly** for consistency.

---

## 📅 Timeline
- **Sep 2025 – Oct 2025** → Python, Math, Stats, Core ML
- **Nov 2025** → Deep Learning (Neural Nets, CNN, RNN)
- **Dec 2025** → Generative AI, LangChain, Agentic AI
